            This document describes how a DNS client can use a domain
            name to authenticate a DNS server that uses
            Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Datagram TLS
            (DTLS). Additionally, it defines (D)TLS profiles for DNS
            clients and servers implementing DNS-over-TLS and
            DNS-over-DTLS.

          <section title="Background">
            <t>
              DNS privacy requires encrypting the query (and response)
              to protect against passive attacks. Such encryption
              typically provides integrity protection as a side-effect,
              which means on-path attackers cannot simply inject bogus
              DNS responses. However, to provide protection against
              active attackers pretending to be the server, the client
              must authenticate the server.
            </t>
          </section>
          <section title="Bootstrapping Problems">
            <t>
              Many TLS clients use <xref target="RFC6125">PKIX
              authentication</xref> based on a domain name for the
              server they are contacting.  These clients typically
              first look up the server's network address in the DNS
              before making this connection. A DNS client therefore
              has a bootstrap problem. DNS clients typically know only the
              IP address of a DNS server.
            </t>
            <t>
              As such, before connecting to a DNS server, a
              DNS client needs to learn the domain name it should associate 
              with the IP address of a DNS server.

            DNS clients issuing queries under an

            result of the authentication attempt.

            DNS clients with multiple resolvers

            (D)TLS resolvers. Doing so would invalidate the
            protections offered against an active attacker.
            [SARA->DKG: I think I see what you are getting at here, but I think of it that
            the 'profile' is a setting that applies to the
            resolution of a particular query, it is
            not a property a DNS server (nor the client). And so I think that is
            true of both opportunistic or strict.]

        <section title="Authentication for Strict (D)TLS Privacy">
          <t>
            To authenticate a privacy-enabling DNS server, the DNS
            client needs to know the domain name for each
            server it is willing to contact.  This is necessary to
            protect against active attacks on DNS privacy.
          </t>
          <t>
            A DNS client requiring strict privacy MUST either use one of the 
            sources listed in <xref
            target="identifier-sources"/> to obtain a domain name for
            the server it contacts, or use an SPKI pinset as described
            in <xref target="I-D.ietf-dprive-dns-over-tls"/>.
          </t>
          <t>
            A DNS client requiring strict privacy MUST only attempt to connect to DNS
            servers for which either a domain name or a SPKI pinset is
            known (or both). The client MUST use the available
            verification mechanisms described in <xref
            target="credentials"/> to authenticate the server, and
            MUST abort connections to a server when no verification
            mechanism succeeds.
          </t>
          <t>
           With strict privacy, the DNS client MUST NOT provide DNS
           service until at least one of the privacy-enabling DNS servers becomes
           available.
          </t>
          <t>
            [ TODO: discuss situations where one name is sufficient
            for all IP addresses, or whether we want to mandate a
            strict one-to-one mapping of names to IP addresses ]
          </t>
          <t>
            A privacy-enabling DNS server may be temporarily unavailable when
            configuring a network.  For example, for clients on
            networks that require registration through web-based login
            (a.k.a. "captive portals"), such registration may rely on
            DNS interception and spoofing.  Techniques such as those
            used by DNSSEC-trigger [dnssec-trigger] MAY be used during

              When a DNS client configured with a domain name connects
              to its configured DNS server over TLS or DTLS, the
              server may present it with an X.509 certificate.  The
              DNS client uses <xref target="RFC6125"/> validation
              techniques to compare the domain name to the certificate
              provided.
            </t>
            <t>
              A DNS client constructs two Reference Identifiers for
              the server based on the domain name: A DNS-ID and an
              <xref target="RFC4985">SRV-ID</xref>.  The DNS-ID is
              simply the domain name itself.  The SRV-ID uses a
              "_domain-s." prefix.  So if the configured domain name is
              "dns.example.com", then the two Reference Identifiers
              are:
              <list style="ordered">
                <t>

            <t>
              If either of the Reference Identifiers are found in the
              X.509 certificate's subjectAltName extension as
