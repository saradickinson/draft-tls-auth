            This document describes how a DNS client can use a domain
            name to authenticate a DNS server that uses
            Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Datagram TLS
            (DTLS). Additionally, it defines (D)TLS profiles for DNS
            clients and servers implementing DNS-over-TLS and
            DNS-over-DTLS.

          <section title="Background">
            <t>
              To protect against passive attacks DNS privacy requires 
              encrypting the query (and response). Such encryption
              typically provides integrity protection as a side-effect,
              which means on-path attackers cannot simply inject bogus
              DNS responses. For DNS privacy to provide protection against
              both passive attacks and active attackers pretending to be
              the server, the client must authenticate the server.
            </t>
          </section>
          <section title="Usage Profiles">
            <t>A DNS client has a choice of privacy
                usage profiles available. This choice is briefly discussed in
                both <xref target="I-D.ietf-dprive-dns-over-tls"/> and
                <xref target="I-D.ietf-dprive-dnsodtls"/>. In summary, the usage
                profiles are:
                <list style="symbols">
                    <t>Strict Privacy: the DNS client requires both an encrypted
                        and authenticated connection to a DNS Server. A hard
                        failure occurs if this is not available. This requires
                        the client to securely obtain information it can use to
                        authenticate the server.
                        This provides strong privacy guarantees to the client. 
                        This is discussed in detail in <xref target="strict"/>.
                    </t>
                    <t>Opportunistic Privacy: the DNS client uses Opportunistic
                        Security as described in <xref target="RFC7435"/>
                        <list style="none"><t>"... the use of cleartext as the 
                            baseline communication security policy, with 
                            encryption and authentication negotiated and applied
                            to the communication when available."</t>
                        </list>
                        In the best case scenario (authenticated and encrypted 
                        connection)
                        this is equivalent to Strict Privacy, in the worst case
                        (clear text connection) this is equivalent to No Privacy.
                        Clients will try for the best case but are willing to
                        fallback to intermediate cases and eventually the
                        worst case scenario in order to obtain a response.
                        This provides an undetermined privacy guarantee to the
                        user depending on what
                        kind of connection is actually used. This is discussed
                        in section <xref target="opportunistic"/>
                    </t>
                    <t>No Privacy: the DNS client does not require or attempt to
                       use either encryption or authentication. Queries are always
                        sent in clear text. This provides no privacy guarantees
                        to the client.

                  Many (D)TLS clients use <xref target="RFC6125">PKIX
                  authentication</xref> based on a domain name for the
                  server they are contacting.  These clients typically
                  first look up the server's network address in the DNS
                  before making this connection. A DNS client therefore
                  has a bootstrap problem. DNS clients typically know only the
                  IP address of a DNS server.

                  As such, before connecting to a DNS server, a

            To authenticate a privacy-enabling DNS server, a DNS

            the server it contacts, or use an SPKI pinset as described

          <t>
            A DNS client requiring Strict Privacy MUST only attempt to connect
            to DNS servers for which either a domain name or a SPKI pinset is
            known (or both). The client MUST use the available
            verification mechanisms described in <xref

            MUST abort connections to a server when no verification
            mechanism succeeds.

          <t>
           With Strict Privacy, the DNS client MUST NOT commence sending DNS

               <t>There are known attacks on (D)TLS, such as machine-in-the-middle

               considerations of <xref target="RFC7525"/> except with respect to
               (D)TLS version. Since encryption of DNS using (D)TLS is virtually

        <section title="Server capability probing and caching by DNS clients" anchor="probing">

             <t>This section presents a non-normative discussion of how DNS
                 clients might probe for and cache privacy capabilities of DNS
                 servers.</t>
             <t>
                Deployment of both DNS-over-TLS and DNS-over-DTLS
                will be gradual.  Not all servers will support one or both of these
                protocols and the well-known port might be blocked by some
                middleboxes. Clients will be expected to keep track of servers
                that support DNS-over-TLS and/or DNS-over-DTLS, and those that
                have been previously authenticated.</t>

            <t> If no server capability information is available then (unless
                otherwise specified by the configuration of the DNS client) DNS
                clients that implement both TLS and DTLS should try to authenticate
                using both protocols before failing or falling back to a
                lower security. DNS clients using opportunistic security should
                try all available servers (possibly in parallel) in order to
                obtain an authenticated
                encrypted connection before falling back to a lower security.
                (RATIONALE: This approach can increase latency while discovering
                server capabilities but maximizes the chance of sending the
                query over an authenticated encrypted connection.) </t>

                <!--<t> [TODO: Should we make recommendations about what to do if
                    a previously authenticated server starts failing authentication?]
                    After review, removed for the first version.</t>-->
